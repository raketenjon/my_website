abstract: In recent years, more and more individuals derive income from online work, often relying on platforms to distribute their products and services. An interesting industry in that context is that of user-generated content platforms. To create maximum user attention, these platforms typically require their contributors to grant users free access to their content. Professional contributors can therefore only monetize their content subsequently (e.g. through advertisement deals), with the income potential being highly dependent on the user attention they create. To study the competitive behavior of these individual contributors, we use the live streaming platform Twitch, where users broadcast a diverse portfolio of entertaining and interactive live video content. In the absence of price competition, professional contributors (streamers) can only choose what type of content they offer and when to do so. Furthermore, streamers have complete information on the moves of their competitors and can adapt in a timely manner, whereas viewers face relatively low switching costs. In this context, we provide empirical results, showing that streamers tend to pursue temporary clustering strategies in timing and content choice, similarly to the basic ideas of the Hotelling-model. However, not all components of these strategies seem to actually increase audience size.
