abstract: Marketers have identified user-generated content as valuable tool to reach potential consumers and increase product sales. Through direct and indirect promotion of products, especially social media influencers take up a key role in UGC-focused marketing campaigns. However, whereas the typical influencer content simply features a (physical) product to display its appeal or usability, the same does not necessarily apply for content on entertainment products such as video games. Especially on (live) streaming platforms such as Twitch and YouTube many video games can be perceived fully by watching the broadcasts of streamers, which enables their viewers to consume the games vicariously and thus, might eradicate any reasons to buy these games for themselves. In this context, the goal of this paper is to assess whether the promotional aspects of UGC dominate the potentially substituting aspects of vicarious consumption for entertainment products. Results from a GMM regression show that viewer numbers on Twitch do not have a positive effect on video games sales (measured through the number of reviews on the platform Steam as proxy variable). However, the number of broadcasting channels does have a positive effect on video games sales, indicating that overall, vicarious consumption seems not be harmful for product sales.
