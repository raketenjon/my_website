I am a research associate at the Institute of Strategic Management of the University of Münster. In my dissertation with the title "Content Creation in the Digital Economy - Perspectives on User Behavior" I studied how professional users strategically operate on content platforms as well as how user-generated content can affects consumer users in different aspects.
